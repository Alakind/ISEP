# 3. (Web) application framework for the backend

Date: 2024-11-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our team members have some experience working within the Spring Boot framework, and so do our clientâ€™s developers.

## Decision

Do we want to adopt this framework for our server backends?

## Consequences

This allows us to plug in other libraries from the Spring ecosystem for functionalities like database connections.
