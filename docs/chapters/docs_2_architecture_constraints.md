| Code Language              | Technical  | The language needs to be familiar to developers at InfoSupport, so they can expand it. For the backend we were decided on Kotlin and for the frontend we decided on React with Typescript VITE                               |
| Testing Language           | Technical  | The language needs to be familiar to developers at InfoSupport, so they can expand it. For the backend we were decided on Junit and for the frontend we decided on VITEST                                                    |
| Back-end must run on Azure | Technical  | The back-end must run on the Microsoft Azure cloud, as this is a service used in the company.                                                                                                                                |

| Front-end Browser Support  | Technical  | Applicants wil have to use the front-end in a web browser, so there should be a wide support of browsers supported. Firefox Chrome, Opera, Edge. We are not able to test Safari, even though it needs to be able to be used. |
| BEM naming convention      | Convention | To keep the hierarchy of the code transparent, we opted to use the BEM naming convention in CSS styles.                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                           
| Multiple-Choice Page       | Business   | All multiple choice questions need to be displayed on one section as that is the standard used by InfoSupport.                                                                                                               |
