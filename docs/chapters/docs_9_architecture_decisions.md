# 9. Architecture Decisions

## 9.1 General

## 9.2 Front-end
### 9.2.1 General
#### 9.2.1.1 React + TypeScript
React and TypeScript were chosen for the development of the front-end of the Asserberus applicant, because it has the option to reuse standard components and make your own components. 

### 9.2.2 Applicant
#### 9.2.2.1 Image support
In the current version images are not yet supported, this will be added in a later iteration.

#### 9.2.2.2 Question support
Open, Multiple-Choice (radio/checkbox) and basic coding questions are supported in the interface. The reason for adding open question is that it is the basic implementation of a question, which 
can support several types of question. The only disadvantage is that it can't be checked automatically if it is correct. The multiple-choice questions can have single answers or multiple answers, 
which are shown differently in the interface.
